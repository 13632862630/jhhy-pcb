      <h3>Take The Chance Of”The Belt and Road” By Mature PCB Fabrication Technology And Innovation. CHINA PCB INDUSTRIAL OBSERVATION Exclusive Interview JHHY. (Extract).</h3>
      <!-- <br> -->
      <p>Since the meeting of "The Belt and Road National Statistics" held in Xi'an 2015, many enterprises are responding to the government's call, go to southeast Asia with the support of government policy. We saw several PCB enterprise attended THAILAND PCB EXPO 2017, JHHY was one of them, and we had interviewed their market officer to have a known about their layout.</p>
      <p><b>Ms Yu Li from 《CHINA PCB INDUSTRIAL OBSERVATION》(hereinafter referred to as "Li"):</b> Many China domestic PCB fabrication enterprises have to transform their business type because of the increasing of labor cost, and many of them moved their factory to inland city with the policy support of inland city government, why don’t JHHY put your eyes on southeast Asia? Except the "The Belt and Road National Statistics" support, are there other causes?</p>
      <p><b>Ming Xu, Marketing Officer of JHHY (hereinafter referred to as "Xu"):</b> Compare with the inland city, southeast Asia is more competitive in labor cost, and also their is policy support here, meanwhile, we have brother companies who have been here for years, with their help, we could establish branch here directly.</p>
      <p><b>Li:</b> Will JHHY transfer your whole company to southeast Asia? Or just establish PCB fabrication base here?</p>
      <p><b>Xu:</b> Just as you said just now, PCB fabrication enterprises must transfer their business type now. It’s not only because the increase of labor cost, the real cause is the change of competition mechanism, our company became the largest manufacturing country by competitive labor cost, but now we are losing this advantages, only develop our technology, we could survive. So, JHHY will pay more and more attention to technology, we have mature PCB fabrication technology, but we need to put more attention to technology innovation. It would be easier for us to communicate with colleagues in the PCB industry, and easier for us to find technical talents. Meanwhile, we will establish PCB fabrication base on southeast China, but keep our domestic fabrication base to support our domestic customers.</p>
