      <p>As a PCB manufacturer with 10+ years experience, our customers are around the world and we have been answering their questions, so we are aggregating questions below for our new customers to know about our businesses.</p>
      <p class="h3">1. Who is JHHY?</p>
      <p>JHHY is a PCB manufacturer located in China, we specializing in PCB prototyping, low-volume production and mass production. We offer quick turn PCBs at a very budgetary price. Our PCBs are widely applied in communication, industrial control, power electronics, medical instrument, security electronics, aerospace and so on. 80% of them are exported to America, Europe and other Asia, we try to get customer's full satisfaction with our technology and good service.</p>
      <p class="h3">2. What is your business hours?</p>
      <p>We will start to review your details whenever your order or email reaches us. We work 7/24/365.</p>
      <p class="h3">3. How can I get a quote?</p>
      <p>You can send specifications to <a href="mailto: sales@jhhy-pcb.com"><u>sales@jhhy-pcb.com</u></a>, or you can find more contact methods on <a href="">contact</a>page. then our sales will quote directly.</p>
      <p class="h3">4. Are your PCBs RoHS Compliant?</p>
      <p>Yes. But we also offer leaded PCBs.</p>
      <p class="h3">5. What are your capabilities of PCB fabrication?</p>
      <p>We have capabilities of manufacturing most of the PCBs for our customers. If you find your PCBs need special processing or you are not sure if we have the ability to produce or not, please contact us at <a href="mailto: sales@jhhy-pcb.com"><u>sales@jhhy-pcb.com</u></a> for an answer, attaching your Gerber files and all other files or drawings for us to assess if we can do or not. For the full list of our PCB Capabilities, please refer to <a href="image/capability-e.pdf"><u>Capabilities</u></a>.</p>
      <p class="h3">6. Why do I need to panelize my boards?</p>
      <p>Panelization is needed when your PCB dimension is smaller than 50mmx100mm, or when your PCB is of any shapes (circular, or odd shape) other than rectangle, your boards must be panelized in an array for fabrication. You can pre-panelize at your side, or we can also panelize for you. In the latter case, we will send the panelization file back to you for your approval before fabrication begins. Panelization is a MUST if your PCBs will use surface mounting machines for assembly.</p>
      <p class="h3">7. Why do I need to design Break-away Rails (Break-away Tabs) ?</p>
      <p>If the clearance between the board’s edge and copper features is less than 3.5mm (138mil), or your boards need to be panelized for some reason, Break-away rails (Break-away tabs) must be added at the two longer paralleled edges of the boards to ensure that the boards can be assembled by the SMT machine.</p>
      <p class="h3">8. How does your privacy policy work?</p>
      <p>We respect the privacy of all our customers. We promise we will never share your personal information with any third parties.</p>
      <p class="h3">9. What if I am dissatisfied with your PCBs?</p>
      <p>If you find any defects with your PCBs upon receipt in you hand, or if you feel any dissatisfaction about our products or services, please immediately let us know via service@jhhy-pcb.com, we will respond within 24 hours. We will serve you till you are finally satisfied. We will either repair or re-fabricate your PCB if quality issue occurs, or we will refund full amount to you without returning the defective PCBs.</p>
      <p class="h3">10. When does the turn-time begin?</p>
      <p>Due to the complexity of how to determine the turn time of PCB fabrication, our policy is that turn-time begins immediately after your Gerber files and all other necessary files being reviewed by us and re-approved by your side. When all these reviews and approvals are done, we will start fabrication immediately.</p>
      <p class="h3">11. What if courier company (DHL etc.,) fails to deliver my PCBs as scheduled?</p>
      <p>This does happen from time to time, though pretty rare. If this happens, please contact courier company for updated time of delivery. Though legally we are not responsible for the delay, we still will track or phone call courier company for updates. The worst case is that we will remake PCBs for you and re-ship to you. For the extra courier charges, we may talk to courier company for compensation.</p>
      <p class="h3">12. Who will be responsible for the customs duty that may be levied at my country?</p>
      <p>As JHHY fabricate your PCBs in our facilities in Shenzhen China, we ship internationally to your country. As the customs policy in different countries may be different, some customs authorities in some countries may levy customs duty on imported PCBs. If this happens, it is your responsibility to pay. In many countries, the duty may be waived or exempted.</p>
